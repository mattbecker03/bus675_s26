# BUS675 - Advanced Business Machine Learning

Welcome! This repo has everything you'll need for the course - lectures, labs, exercises, data, and more.

## What's in here?

- **lectures/** - Jupyter notebooks for each class
- **labs/** - Hands-on assignments (usually take two class periods plus work outside of class)
- **data/** - All the datasets we'll use
- **images/** - All the images from the lectures
- **supplemental/** - Supplemental code, specific to lectures or labs

## How this works

You'll get your own private copy of this repo through GitHub Classroom. That way you can edit the lecture notebooks, take notes, mess around with code, and I can see what you're working on. 

**The key thing**: Make sure you **push** your work (don't just commit locally) so I can actually see your progress.

### Initial Setup

Once you accept the GitHub Classroom assignment and clone your repo, run this **one time** from a terminal in `/path/to/your_repo`:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/ChapmanMSBA/bus675_s26.git
```

### Getting New Material

When I add new stuff, I'll give you a heads up to run:

```bash
git pull upstream main
```

If you get merge conflicts, no worries - just keep your local changes.


## What to expect

Lecture notebooks have explanations, code examples, and exercises built right in. Labs are more comprehensive and let you practice with real-world scenarios.

## Questions?

Hit me up via email or just ask in class.
